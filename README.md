# -Anomaly-Detection
cyclone preheater detection is a critical process in industrial settings, particularly in cement manufacturing, where it plays a significant role in energy efficiency and emissions control. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the system and its components based on the provided information:
# Objective:
Using python and any algorithm of your choice, highlight time periods where this abnormality can be observed.

# Key Parameters Monitored
Cyclone Inlet Gas Temperature: Measures the temperature of gases entering the cyclone.

Cyclone Material Temperature: Monitors the temperature of materials within the cyclone.

Cyclone Outlet Gas Draft: Evaluates the draft pressure of gases exiting the cyclone.

Cyclone Cone Draft: Assesses draft pressure within the cone section of the cyclone.

Cyclone Gas Outlet Temperature: Records the temperature of gases leaving the cyclone.

Cyclone Inlet Draft: Measures draft pressure at the inlet of the cyclone.

# Conclusion
The effective detection of cyclone preheaters involves continuous monitoring of various parameters to ensure efficient operation, prevent failures, and maintain compliance with environmental standards. By leveraging data analysis techniques, industries can enhance their operational reliability and sustainability.
